# ============================================================================
# FORK MODIFICATION: Automated Package Release Workflow
# ============================================================================
# This workflow automatically uploads build artifacts from the packaging
# workflow to a continuously updated "Latest Packages" GitHub release.
#
# Purpose:
#   - Runs after packaging workflow completion on master branch (success or failure)
#   - Downloads successful package artifact archives (one per distro-version-arch)
#   - Creates zip archives for each build job's packages
#   - Uploads archives to a single "latest" release (not individual packages)
#   - Gracefully handles partial build failures
#   - Does not fail if some package builds failed
#
# Release Structure:
#   - Each asset is a .zip archive containing packages for one distro-version-arch
#   - Example: ubuntu-24.04-amd64-packages.zip, debian-12-arm64-packages.zip
#   - Users download only the archive they need for their system
#   - SHA256SUMS file included for verification
#
# Merge Considerations:
#   - This is a fork-specific workflow file
#   - Should not conflict with upstream as it's not present in upstream
#   - Safe to keep during merges from netdata/netdata

            ### Installation Instructions

            #### Step 1: Download
            Download the archive for your distribution, version, and architecture:
            ```bash
            # Example for Ubuntu 24.04 on amd64
            wget https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/releases/download/latest/ubuntu-24.04-amd64-packages.zip
            ```

            #### Step 2: Verify Checksum
            ```bash
            # Download checksum file
            wget https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/releases/download/latest/SHA256SUMS

            # Verify the archive
            sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
            ```

            #### Step 3: Extract Archive
            ```bash
            # Extract the zip file
            unzip ubuntu-24.04-amd64-packages.zip

            # Navigate to extracted directory
            cd ubuntu-24.04-amd64-packages/
            ```

            #### Step 4: Install Packages

            **For Debian/Ubuntu (.deb):**
            ```bash
            sudo dpkg -i netdata_*.deb
            sudo apt-get install -f  # Fix any dependency issues
            ```

            **For RHEL/CentOS/Fedora/Rocky (.rpm):**
            ```bash
            sudo rpm -i netdata-*.rpm
            # or
            sudo dnf install netdata-*.rpm
            ```

            ### Notes
            - ⚠️ Packages are **unsigned** (fork build)
            - For official signed packages, visit https://github.com/netdata/netdata
            - Use `--force-confold` with dpkg if you have custom configurations
            - Each archive may contain multiple package files (main package + plugins)
            - If some archives are missing, check the [workflow run](${{ github.event.workflow_run.html_url }}) for build errors
